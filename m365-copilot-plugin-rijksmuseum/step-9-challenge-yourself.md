# Step 9: Challenge yourself

It could be that you finished earlier than the 60 minutes of this session or that you want to expand your plug-in maybe at a later stage. Below are some ideas which you can think of adding to your plug-in:
-	make it possible to search on art object type
-	make it possible to search on art objects created in a specific year
-	make it possible to search for art objects created in the same year as art object X
-	make it possible to find art objects which are created using a specific technique
-	extend the maximum number of returned objects to above 10
-	exclude art objects from the results if no image is available

|Keep in mind that maximum number of parameters per command is currently 5.
The maximum number of commands is 10 from which you can define 9 yourself.|

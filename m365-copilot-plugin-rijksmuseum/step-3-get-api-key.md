## Getting an API-key

Since we donâ€™t let all our users create an account for the API we are going to use an API-key. This will allow every user who has access to the plug-in to query the data.
Follow the steps below to create an API-key:

1.	Login with you **Rijksstudio account**
2.	Once logged in select the avatar in the top right corner
3.	Click on the **gear** next to the option **uitloggen**
4.	Browse to the bottom and click on advanced, a new section will open where you will the **Rijksmuseum API**
5.	Click on the button in this section to it to request an API key and not down the value
